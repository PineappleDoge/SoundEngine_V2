# SoundEngine_V2
A rewrite of the original Sonic Sound Engine for the Roblox platform. Improved performance, additional features, and a more modulated coding-style.


## Why make a SoundEngineV2
Originally planned to just be an updated soundengine for TURBOBOOST!, the project has grown in scope to be a complete overhaul of the original codebase, aiming to make the code more maintainable and modulated, alongside documentation and extensive customization options for new and experienced programmers alike.
